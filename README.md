# Rasplind #100DaysOfCode Challenge

My journey through these one hundred days will be split into three parts;
### 1. Learning stage. 
Here I will do my best to learn and prepare myself for building a fullscale website using React, Redux, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL.
I hope I can learn Redux and Express "as I go", and I already feel I have a basic understanding of PSQL.
So step one will be to get into React and Node to the point where I feel ready to move on to step 2.

### 2. Project start. 
Here I will start working on my project, which will be a full-scale website.
Earlier in my days, I managed to build something I placed under the "Browser Game" genre using PHP.
So I'm thinking my step 3 will be to build a different game, and this time obviously using these JS frameworks.
But, step 2 will be to build a skeleton with user authentication, user roles and an admin panel ready to monitor stuff from the database.
I'm thinking this skeleton can be used in further projects as a nice "starting ground" for me to build on.
So with that in mind, I want to keep this as secure I can to protect my apps from injections, XSS, session hijacking and so on.

### 3. The final step, reaching the end goal. 
Using my skeleton from step 2, I want to start building a browser game.
I decided to go for a browser game as I felt I learned A LOT by building one in PHP. 
And if I can get to the same level of understanding JS, React and Node as I did understanding PHP by my PHP project, I will be a very happy man. :tada:

>Day 6:
>Spent learning about styling and debugging React components.

>Day 5:
>Completed chapter and assignment about lists and conditionals.

>Day 4:
>Started a codealong course on Udemy to help me learn stuff right from start.
>Rushed through the first few sections of basic JS and React components, props and state.

>Day 3:
>Continued on the path of learning React, built a few very basic frontend apps following some tutorials.

>Day 2:
>As I knew since day two that I was not ready to work on something "large" yet, I decided to just take my time learning React from scratch.
>Spent most of the day following tutorials and learning about React props and components, playground level.

>Day 1:
>Started off doing a lot of basic JS practice and example projects. Just wanted to make sure I was ready to jump into React and NodeJS.
