# Rasplind #100DaysOfCode Challenge
Erik

My journey through these one hundred days will be split into three parts;
### 1. Learning stage. 
Here I will do my best to learn and prepare myself for building a fullscale website using React, Redux, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL.
I hope I can learn Redux and Express "as I go", and I already feel I have a basic understanding of PSQL.
So step one will be to get into React and Node to the point where I feel ready to move on to step 2.

### 2. Project start. 
Here I will start working on my project, which will be a full-scale website.
Earlier in my days, I managed to build something I placed under the "Browser Game" genre using PHP.
So I'm thinking my step 3 will be to build a different game, and this time obviously using these JS frameworks.
But, step 2 will be to build a skeleton with user authentication, user roles and an admin panel ready to monitor stuff from the database.
I'm thinking this skeleton can be used in further projects as a nice "starting ground" for me to build on.
So with that in mind, I want to keep this as secure I can to protect my apps from injections, XSS, session hijacking and so on.

### 3. The final step, reaching the end goal. 
Using my skeleton from step 2, I want to start building a browser game.
I decided to go for a browser game as I felt I learned A LOT by building one in PHP. 
And if I can get to the same level of understanding JS, React and Node as I did understanding PHP by my PHP project, I will be a very happy man. :tada:

>Day 19:
>B-party for my son, dinner is done, and i can relax with a whiskey and some code all evening!
>Will be working on the auth system tonight, exited to start putting pices together.

>Day 18:
>Exam in school and preparing the weekend for my family, two days in a row with just a few hours of code, sadly.

>Day 17:
>Valentine's day, family time, exams tomorrow. I'll make sure to get atleast 2-3h of code in now tho.
>Will keep working on my authentication system, today i will probably play around with passportjs, bcryptjs and joi.
>Hope to get some insight in how to use them and how they work, and when i need them in my project have an easier time.

>Day 16:
>Started working on my authentication system, progress is slow tho. Got a few exams i'm working on aswell.

>Day 15:
>Played around with API's in NodeJS yesterday, was alot of fun! Now i'm taking a leap forward and starting step two above.
>I will take it in a slow pase, but start working on a full authentication system, with userroles built into it.
>There will be no styling or anything, just a "starting block" for futhure projects. Let's see how far i get..

>Day 14:
>Finally a full day of code after a busy weekend! Will be experimenting with NodeJS all day, will try to build myself an restful API.

>Day 13:
>Continued playing around with Node, starting to really like it.
>Might spend tomorrow working on my discord bot or building an API.

>Day 12:
>Busy day, so sadly not much more then 2h of code.. Wrote a node console app that listed some different PC specs.

>Day 11:
>Started with NodeJS, still not completely done with React. But i just could not wait anymore to play with Node..

>Day 10:
>Started this day with studies in school, having brunch and watching a crash course on Node.js. Spending about 3h on a school assignement and heading back home at lunchtime.
>Once back home, I'll continue work on my React app, and finish that off. Then eighter look on what i might have left to learn in React or start learning Node.

>Day 9:
>Started work on a more "realistic" application. Realistic in this case meening that it looks good(as good i can make it without spending ages) but also working after best practice and making it run smooth.

>Day 8:
>Continuing learning about more complex parts about React. Higher order components, lifecyckles, prop types, ref and different ref types.. Phew!

>Day 7:
>Deeper dive into more advanced React components and React internals.

>Day 6:
>Spent learning about styling and debugging React components.

>Day 5:
>Completed chapter and assignment about lists and conditionals.

>Day 4:
>Started a codealong course on Udemy to help me learn stuff right from start.
>Rushed through the first few sections of basic JS and React components, props and state.

>Day 3:
>Continued on the path of learning React, built a few very basic frontend apps following some tutorials.

>Day 2:
>As I knew since day two that I was not ready to work on something "large" yet, I decided to just take my time learning React from scratch.
>Spent most of the day following tutorials and learning about React props and components, playground level.

>Day 1:
>Started off doing a lot of basic JS practice and example projects. Just wanted to make sure I was ready to jump into React and NodeJS.
