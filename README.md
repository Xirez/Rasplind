# Rasplind 100DaysOfCode Challenge

My jurney through these onehundred days will be split into three parts;
### 1. Learning stage. 
Here i will do my best to learn and prepare myself for building a fullscale website using React, Redux, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.
I hope i can learn Redux and Express "as i go", and i already feel i have a basic understanding of PSQL.
So step one will be to get into React and Node to the point where i feel ready to move on to step 2.

### 2. Project start. 
Here i will start working on my project, wich will be a full scale website.
Earlier in my days i managed to build something I placed under the "Browser Game" genre using PHP.
So i'm thinking my step 3 will be to build a different game, and this time obviously using these JS frameworks.
But, step 2 will be to build a skeleton with userauthentication, userroles and an adminpanel ready to monitor stuff from the database.
I'm thinking this skeleton can be used in futher projects as a nice "starting ground" for me to build on.
So with that in mind, i want to keep this as secure i can to protect my apps from injections, XSS, session hijacking and so on.

### 3. Final step, reaching the end goal. 
Using my skeleton from step 2, i want to start building a browser game.
I decided to go for a browser game as i felt i learnt ALOT by building one in PHP. 
And if i can get to the same level of understanding JS, React and Node as i did understanding PHP by my PHP project, I will be a very happy man.

>Day 3:
>Continued on the path of learning React, built a few very basic frontend apps following some tutorials.
>Day 2:
>As i knew since day two that i was not ready to work on something "large" yet, i decided to just take my time learning React from scratch.
>Spent most of the day following tutorials and learning about React props and components, playground level.
>Day 1:
>Started of doing alot of basic JS practice and example projects. Just wanted to make sure i was ready to jump into React and NodeJS.
